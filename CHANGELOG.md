## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-02

### Added

- `pivx-rpc`: typed async JSON-RPC client for `pivxd` — 48 typed methods
  across blockchain, wallet, shield, masternode, staking, budget, network,
  mempool, mining, and util surfaces, plus a generic `call` for everything
  else.
- `pivx-rpc`: node errors (`Error::Rpc` with the node's code) separated from
  transport failures; poll-based `ShieldWatcher` for node-wallet monitoring.
- `pivx-wallet`: standalone shield (SHIELD/Sapling) wallet — ZIP32 key
  derivation, block scanning with note decryption, checkpointed sync
  verified against `finalsaplingroot`, natively-proved shielded spends.
- `pivx-wallet`: watch-only wallets from a viewing key (scan, receive,
  balance), upgradeable in place with a spending key.
- `pivx-wallet`: `save()`/`load()` of versioned JSON wallet state, pending
  spends included; the format is interchangeable with the JS SDK.
- `pivx-wallet`: transparent HD wallet — BIP44 derivation (coin type 119),
  block-scan or supplied-UTXO receive, ECDSA-signed legacy sends, exchange
  (`EXM`/`EXT`) address support.
